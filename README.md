My name is Isaiah Francis and I have 10 years of creating successful financial strategies in the finance/banking industry. 

But, after helping countless people buy their first home, rebuild their credit, or invest successfully, now I am transitioning into what's been my lifelong passion: Tech.

I am taking the "strategy" side of finance (and finance "know-how") and now applying it to the algorithm-filled world of Tech; specifically, software development and machine learning.
Where I am not an expert in either yet, coming up with inventive mobile apps that help people with completing their goals and using AI to make tasks more automated is something
that i strive to master. 

This is my journey.
